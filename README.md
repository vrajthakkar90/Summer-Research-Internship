# Summer-Research-Internship
This is the report of a study I carried out during my internship at IIEST, Shibpur under the mentorship of Prof. Tanmay Pal(Phd, IIT KGP) after being selected as a summer research fellow(SRFP 2024) by Indian Academy of Sciences(IASc-INSA-NASI). The study is about the computational models of respiratory systems and the math behind them. I would like to thank Prof. Pal for his support and guidance. I would also like to thank Anshuman Bhaiya for helping me with my work and always instilling confidence in me throughout the whole time. Also, I would like to thank Prof. Prosenjit Kundu for referring me for this prestigious opportunity, one of the best teachers and researchers I have met so far.
